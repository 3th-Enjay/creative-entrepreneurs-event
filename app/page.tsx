                <p className="text-white/70 text-sm">From Pastor Fabian</p>
              </div>
              <blockquote className="text-white/90 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-4">
                <p>
                  Entrepreneurship is more than just starting a business; it's about seeing potential where others see
                  limits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's the remarkable ability to take what is scarceâ€”sometimes even what seems like nothingâ€”and turn it
                  into something valuable, something that can grow and benefit not just you but the world around you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A true entrepreneur isn't satisfied with what already exists. They look for the gaps, the unmet needs,
                  and the overlooked problems in the market. Where others see a challenge, they see an opportunity to
                  create something new.
                </p>
                <p>
                  God, in His infinite wisdom, took what didn't exist and spoke the world into being. In the same way,
                  an entrepreneur brings ideas to life by crafting solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Entrepreneurs look at a seed and envision a forest. They understand that growth takes time, effort,
                  and a deep sense of belief in their vision. It's not just about making money; it's about creating
                  value where there was none.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Entrepreneurs see the world not as it is, but as what it could be. They are constantly asking, "What
                  can I do better? Where is there a need that hasn't been addressed? How can I improve on what's already
                  out there?"
                </p>
                <p className="font-semibold">
                  In the end, an entrepreneur's role is to serveâ€”to serve the market, to serve people, and ultimately,
                  to serve a higher purpose. They create solutions not just to make a profit but to make a difference.
                  That's what sets them apart.
                </p>
                <p className="italic">
                  So, when you think about entrepreneurship, think of it as the art of creating something better for the
                  betterment of all.
                </p>
